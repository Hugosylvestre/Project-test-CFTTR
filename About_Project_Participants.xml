  <title>About project participants</title> 
  <shortdesc>Project participants are the people who are allowed to manage
	 review projects and comment on documents. 
  </shortdesc> 
  <conbody> 
	 <p>Every review project has at least one document owner and at least one
		reviewer. When a document is uploaded to 
		<ph id="aph_BC5271148E66415AAFD5F21793E18779_cf"
		 conref="Reusable_Components/XMetaL_Reviewer.xml#ditacomponent_FFA8F9488B214B3B84175A411A134CE6/ph_BC5271148E66415AAFD5F21793E18779"></ph>,
		the user who uploads the document is automatically assigned the role of
		document owner. Document owners may add or remove reviewers for a project, and
		initiate the 
		<b>Prepare Next Draft</b> process. 
	 </p> 
	 <p>Usually, the author is also the document owner; however, the user who
		uploads a document may also assign a different user to be document owner. 
	 </p> 
	 <p>A review project may have more than one user assigned the role of
		author, as documents may be authored by more than person.
